# Practical 4 - Non-rigid image registration

In this practical, you are mainly playing with some code we've already written. This code does non-rigid image registration between 
two images. Because this is a very difficult task, we just use a python library to do it. In this case SimpleITK.

The notebook should be self explanatory, and should follow the structure of your lecture this morning. You can more or less work from 
top to  bottom. (don't run the last cell though!)

Have fun!
