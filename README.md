# Imaging In Radiotherapy
Course materials for the Manchester Imaging in Radiotherapy module

These materials were first used together in the March 2019 edition of the Imaging in Radiotherapy course, taught in the Radiotherapy Related Research department at the University of Manchester. They are an amalgamation of two previous courses, the Bioinformatics module taught at Manchester, and part of a big data workshop course first faught in Colombia in February 2019.

Materials were developed in collaboration with Mat Lowe at the Christie, and Eliana Vasquez Osorio at the University of Manchester.

## How to use the materials
After cloning or downloading the code, run `jupyter notebook` in the directory you end up with. You should then be able to see everything and run all of the code. In theory it is self-contained.

There are a few required modules, listed in requirements.txt. To install them using pip, do a `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You may or may not need to add the `--user` flag, depending on your system.

Note that the materials are developed for python 3.x and might not work or behave strangely on python 2.x
