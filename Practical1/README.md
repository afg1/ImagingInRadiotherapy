# Practical 1 - part 1

In this practical you have to run cells in a notebook, and use what you know about debugging to find the errors, then fix them.

Bear in mind the different types of errors, and how to read the error message! Also, remember the first rule of programming: 

<div align="center">

**Google the error message**

</div>

Good luck!

# Practical 1 - part 2

In this practical you have the following tasks:

Task 1:   
- In this directory is a file called "Files.txt". It contains a list of file names, each of which is contained in the directory "files". 
- A few files are missing because a cat walked over the keyboard during the file copy procedue. Which files are missing?

Task 2:   
- Load the data from the files that are available so that the value inside each file can be quickly found from an integer file ID key. 
- The values are floating point numbers.

Task 3:   
- Produce a histogram of the data. Play around with the number of bins until it looks nice. 
- Try some of the other options like normalisation. Label your axes!

**Remember** There is a python basics notebook in the folder above this one where you can get some more information, if you need it.
