# Basic Python - practical 2

In this practical we will be building an image registration engine. To begin with, it will be a manual registration engine, 
so we will have to write an interface to move/rotate images with the keyboard while we have them displayed.

This practical also requires us to move from jupyter notebooks to proper python scripts. In this folder is a short tutorial 
on the absolute basics of using the commandline in windows. We can still do everything from the browser though!

Apart from that, start with the file Assignment2.py, and fill in the missing bits. A completed version is also in the folder
so you can have a look if you get stuck. Also, remember that there is the python basics notebook if you need to look anything up.

Good luck, and have fun!
